          <h3>Background</h3>
          My journey into the world of coding began when I was young. I had the opportunity to explore various beautiful websites online, 
          and I was so desire to create my own blog websiteâ€”a platform where I could freely express my ideas and creativity. During my college, I began to explore coding skills, 
          experience various programming languages and frameworks, each offering a unique knowledges, it's also enabled me to expand my horizons in design, allowing me to diverse multiple projects with confidence. 
          My journey in coding has been ups and downs, I make a lot of mistake but I also value my learning mistake experience, it pushs my boundaries to make me believe that everything is possible with decication.

          <h3>Boba Challenge</h3>
          Having grow up in Asia, one of the best snacks I can't never live without is bubble tea aka Boba. I am such a boba enthusiast that I can happily enjoy drinking 3 cups in a row!
          For me, life is all about savoring the sweet, and when it comes to Boba, it never fails to bring a smile to my face. Two of my absolute favorite flavor is Taro and Brown Sugar, you can't never go wrong with those at any places. 
          In my opinion, boba is more than just a drink; it's a passion, a little piece of happiness in a plastic cup, and it is my daily dose of joy.
